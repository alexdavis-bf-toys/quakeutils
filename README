The Quake utilties are a collection of small command line applications to help in Quake development.  

The primary goal of this project is to keep the tools available for future use.  No new features/development is planed other then bug fixes and changes to keep it working on multiple platforms.  With this in mind the build system uses scons for cross platform building.

Other then the wad directory all of the tools are from the official qutils package released by ID Software. 
 
wad - provides information about wad files and the ability to extract them.
